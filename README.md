Welcome to my React Native project. This was initialized using the @react-native-community/cli tool.


# Getting Started

>**Heads up**: Please make sure you've followed the React Native - Environment Setup up to the "Creating a new application" section before moving on.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

Metro is the JavaScript bundler that comes along with React Native. Here's how to get it started:

From your project's root directory:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Launching the app

Keep the Metro Bundler running. In a new terminal (still at the project root), execute the following:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

Once executed, the app should appear on your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator, assuming your emulator/simulator settings are correct. Remember, you can also launch the app directly via Android Studio or Xcode.
